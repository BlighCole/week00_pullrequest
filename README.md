# COSC 415: Pull request exercise

1. Send a request to me to get added to this repo (giving me your Github username)
2. Once you've been added, clone the repo to your own computer or to a cloud9 workspace
3. Create a new branch, using your first initial and last name, e.g., `jsommers`
4. Change to that new branch
3. Edit this `README.md` file, under the section below labeled `Your edits`.  Add a couple lines of text to introduce yourself and to say what you did over the summer.
4. Commit the changes to your local repo (make sure the changes go to your branch, not to the `master` branch)
5. Do a `git push origin BRANCH`, where `BRANCH` is replaced with your branch name.
6. Go on to `github.com` in this repo, and create a pull request for your branch.

# Your edits

Replace this text and add a couple lines of text to introduce yourself and say what you did over the summer.
